# 🔐 Password Policy Compliance Analysis

## 📄 Overview

This project is a detailed cybersecurity capstone focused on analyzing password policies across industry-recognized frameworks — **NIST**, **CIS**, and **PCI DSS**. It involves evaluating existing configurations within Windows Active Directory and AWS IAM, identifying compliance gaps, and suggesting actionable improvements.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Review password-related recommendations from:
  - National Institute of Standards and Technology (**NIST**)
  - Center for Internet Security (**CIS**)
  - Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (**PCI DSS**)
- Compare password policy components including length, history, complexity, and expiration.
- Assess local Active Directory password policy settings for compliance.
- Audit AWS IAM password policy for PCI DSS alignment.
- Reference PCI DSS v3.2.1 to extract key configuration and operational mandates.

## ✅ Tasks Performed

### 🔹 Task 1: Standards Comparison
Compiled a policy matrix showing how password configurations align (or don’t) with NIST, CIS, and PCI DSS standards.

### 🔹 Task 2: Windows Active Directory Audit
Analyzed default password policy on Windows Server (via `gpedit.msc`) and compared the settings against standard benchmarks. Recommended secure configurations.

### 🔹 Task 3: AWS IAM Password Policy Review
Audited IAM settings like complexity, reuse prevention, and expiration using AWS Management Console. Ensured policies met PCI DSS guidelines.

### 🔹 Task 4: PCI DSS v3.2.1 Checklist
Extracted and summarized best practices from PCI DSS:
- Firewall reviews
- Patch management timelines
- Vulnerability scanning schedules
- Risk assessment cadence
